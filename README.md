Ever wonderd what if you dont need internet to know anything you want to know about! It could be about anything for that matter. 
And be able to read about what is happening around the world. Well its possible and here it is happening right at this moment. 
So give your hands some rest then still get what you want.

Idea behind doing this is to learn web development using nodejs environment. 
As of now you can subscribe to one match in future for any series you want.

The Application is build using bellow : 
 - The back-end uses [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/) run-time environment written in [javascript]().
 - The front-end uses  [jade](jade-lang.com/) for html, [BootStrap](getbootstrap.com/) and [jQuery](https://jquery.com/).

The external tools used are : 
 - MongoDB to store user data.
 - Redis for creating back-end jobs using Kue module.
